<p>Sprinkler applet</p>
<p>The applet first build a decision tree based model from a training set and then test it against a test set returning the error rate.</p>
<p>The amount of pre pruning can be set from 0 (no prepruning, full tree generation) to 1 (maximum amount of pre pruning, single node tree).</p>
<p>Record set file format:<br>
An input file starts with comments (each comment line starts with <code>#</code>).<br>
A single special line begging with "<code># {</code>" and closed by "<code>}</code>" must be present before the record lines. It indicates attribute domains separated by ":", single domain values are separated by comma, as in the following example.
Each of the next lines specifies a record where attributes are separated by comma. Last attribute is the label associated with the record.
</p>
<code>   
# {x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:x,o,b:positive,negative}
x,x,x,x,o,o,x,o,o,positive
x,x,x,x,o,o,o,x,o,positive
...
